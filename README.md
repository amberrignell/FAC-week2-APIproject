# Rainy With A Chance Of Plague

This is an app in which a user can enter their postcode and see the current weather conditions and number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in their area.

## APIs used

3 APIs were used in the making of this app:

**Postcode API:**
Used to convert a user's postcode into data that is usable by subsequent APIs.
Data required included region/county of the postcode that matched with COVID-19 reporting areas, as well as longitude and latitude for the weather API.
