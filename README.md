# Rainy With A Chance Of Plague ☔

This is an app in which a user can enter their postcode and see the current weather conditions and number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in their area.

## How it all works 🧚‍♀️
Users will will type in their UK postcode and either hit enter or click the "Wish me luck" button. The page will smoothly scroll down to display the following information relating to the inputted postcode:

- Image of the current weather condition
- Weather description (e.g. "light rain", "overcast clouds")
- Temperature in degree celsius
- Number of Covid-19 cases

If the user inputs and invalid or inexistent postcode a pop-up message will be displayed "Couldn't find [inputted postcode]"

## APIs used

3 APIs were used in the making of this app:

**Postcode API:**
Used to convert a user's postcode into data that is usable by subsequent APIs.
Data required included region/county of the postcode that matched with COVID-19 reporting areas, as well as longitude and latitude for the weather API.

**Weather API:**
Takes longitude and latitude as arguments. Used to return basic weather conditions (i.e. 'clouds', 'clear sky') and temperature. Temperatures converted to Celsius.
